LWFS is a flexible, powerful, POSIX-compliant cluster filesystem
that can scale to several petabytes.

LWFS works over either TCP/IP or high-performance Infiniband RDMA
interconnect.

LWFS provides striping and on-the-fly synchronous replication
of files. LWFS has a fully distributed design, with no
single point of failure.
